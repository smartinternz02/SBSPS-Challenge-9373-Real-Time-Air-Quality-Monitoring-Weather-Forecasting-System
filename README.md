Created A small project for predicting Air Quality Index using #sklearn
pandas seborn numpy matplotlib and Streamlit 
I didn't use any special pipelines they were 16 columns but used only 3 columns which were highly correlated AQI columns this was Originally a classification problem but I converted it into a Regression problem Statement by Choosing AQI as the Target value for the Model I used Support Vector Regression from SVM in Sklearn and creating Data App I Chose Streamlit I got other options too like Flask and Gradio it took me one Day just a Fun ðŸŽƒ Project #Sunday I have linked My GitHub link please do try just a fun Project project data like
